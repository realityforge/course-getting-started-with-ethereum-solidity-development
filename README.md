## Create Truffle Project From Box

Truffle has the idea of a `"box"` which is really just a project template that you can use to initialize
a project. The course itself has created it's own box on GitHub at [chainskills/chainskills-box](https://github.com/chainskills/chainskills-box)
and we used it to initialize the `chainskills` project via:

    > mkdir chainlist
    > cd chainlist
    > truffle unbox chainskills/chainskills-box
